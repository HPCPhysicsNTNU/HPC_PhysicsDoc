Our vision
==========

Give our users a competitive advantage in the international science race.


Goal
----

Contribute to make our scientists the most efficient users of High Performance
Computing (HPC), by creating the best support environment for any HPC user,
and present them to the most efficient solutions to support their highest
demands in HPC.


Services
--------

The HPC-Group works within three areas:

* Technical and Operational computing resource support to the national
  program, and local initiatives.
* Basic and Advanced user support to projects and research groups that
  utilizes HPC or is expecting to do so in the future.
* Involvement in national development projects and initiatives, for instance
  in GRID Computing and new technology areas.


National resource site
----------------------

Since 2000 UiT has been a Resource Site in the National High Performance
Computing Consortium (NOTUR), a joint mission between the four Norwegian
Universities in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim and Tromsø. Since December 2014
UNINETT Sigma2 manages the national infrastructure and offers High Performance
Computing and Data Storage.

Regional resource site
----------------------

The HPC group at UiT also has a role to play as a regional resource site
within HPC, offering HPC services to other institutions in Northern Norway. A
strategic collaboration between UiT and the Norwegian Polar Institute within
HPC has been ongoing since 1998.
